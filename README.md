# InstacartBasketAnalysis
I used Python to clean and analyze multiple datasets, creating a detailed report with visualizations and recommendations. This report addresses key business questions and offers insights to enhance market segmentation strategies, aiming to drive improved sales and strategic decisions.
# Objective
Instacart, an online grocery store with strong sales, seeks to gain deeper insights into their sales patterns. My role as an analyst involved performing initial data and exploratory analysis to uncover hidden trends and provide recommendations for improved market segmentation based on the specified criteria.
# Key Questions
1. What are the current sales patterns and trends across different product categories?
2. How do sales vary by geographic region and time of day?
3. What customer segments show the highest purchasing frequency and value?
4. Are there any correlations between promotional activities and sales performance?
